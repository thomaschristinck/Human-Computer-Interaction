# Human-Computer Interaction

A project I worked on with Saahil Hamayun and Albert Ma for ECSE 424 - Human Computer Interaction at McGill University. The project aimed to help better facilitate question-asking in large auditorium-style lectures at McGill University. The website is currently not maintained, but can be accessed [here](https://classroom-friend.herokuapp.com/) (the Site is Chrome-accessible only; Safari and Firefox users might experience some rendering issues).
